Hey, I'm __Anil Antony__

Full Stack Developer at  [__Settlin__](https://www.settlin.in)

I'm a digital builder who thrives on translating real-world challenges into innovative digital solutions.

Rather than chasing coding competitions, I'm motivated by the joy of creation. I build because I'm curious, not just to compete. Solving genuine problems with elegant digital products is my passion.

My work speaks volumes, even if it's not the loudest in the room. Every line of code represents my dedication to transforming ideas into practical solutions.



Looking forward to connecting with you!
